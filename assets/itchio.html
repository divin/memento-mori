<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Reflect on the preciousness of time with "memento mori" for Playdate.</p>
<p>This simple application provides a perspective on your estimated lifespan based on statistical data. After an initial setup, it displays:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Your estimated life expectancy.</li>
    <li>The approximate time remaining in years, months, weeks, and days.</li>
    <li>The percentage of your estimated life already lived.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, the app features a "lockscreen" mode. In this mode, the screen update rate is reduced to 1 frame per second (FPS), and the Playdate's automatic screen lock is disabled. This allows the display to remain on continuously with minimal battery consumption.</p>
<p>
    <em><strong>Privacy Note:</strong> The information required for setup (country, gender, and date of birth) is stored <strong>only</strong> locally on your Playdate device. It is never transmitted or shared.</em>
</p>
<p>
    <em><strong>Data Source:</strong> Life expectancy estimates are based on data provided by the World Health Organization (WHO).</em>
</p>
