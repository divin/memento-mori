# PlayUI

A lightweight UI components library for Playdate game development, making UI creation faster and more intuitive.

**NOTE**: This is an early version which was created for this project. Please check my [GitHub](https://github.com/divin), when you read this I might have released a dedicated repository for this project. The classes defined are very unstable and buggy.
